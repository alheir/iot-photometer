# Fotómetro IoT

This repository contains the source code, documentation, and hardware details for the "Fotómetro IoT," an IoT light meter designed by Ing. Daniel Jacoby (ITBA / GEDA). Based on the TSL2561 sensor, it measures illuminance with WiFi/cloud connectivity and serial output, including MATLAB scripts for LCD gamma testing.

## Overview
The Fotómetro IoT is a versatile light meter that supports both standalone and cloud-connected modes. It integrates with MATLAB for automated gamma measurements of LCD displays and provides real-time data via serial or cloud.
